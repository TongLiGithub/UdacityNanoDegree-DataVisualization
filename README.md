## Summary
In this project I visualized the relationship between passengers' survival (whether they were survived or perished) on Titanic and passengers' gender, class aboard, and number of siblings/spouses traveled with them.     
                  
               
## Design 
### Exploratory Analysis
I used logistic regression to analyse the dataset (titanic-data.csv) in Rstudio. I found that passengers' class, sex, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and age are related to their survival. Overall, female passengers tend to have better chance to survive than male passengers, and passengers in class 1 and 2 are more likely to survive compared to passengers in class 3. In different classes, the chance to survive of males and females were not all the same, which represented by a significant interaction between Sex and Pclass in the logistic regression model. In addition, passengers with spouse or more siblings traveled with them had lower chance to survive. The survival rate also varied in different age groups.

Bar plots were used to exhibit the relationship between these four variables and survival.                 
                               
### Initial Decisions in Visualization
I used dimple to visualize the data. I considered other types of plots (e.g., bubble plot, line plot), but after I tried them, I went back to my original thought that bar plots were sufficient to present the relationship between these four variables and survival. 

The initial plots can be generated by running titanic_initial.html. The first plot is to show the interaction between Sex and Pclass and how the two variables are related to survival. The second one is to show the relationship between number of siblings/spouse aboard and survival. The third one is to show the relationship between different age groups and survival.     
                          
                      
## Feedback and Final Decisions
### Feedback from Three Reviewers:
**Reviewer 1:** I think it is better to be consistent with the y axis in the three plots. Why did you change in the second plot where you used the x axis to show how many people were survived or perished? I don't think there is any good reasons for that. And all the plots need titles.     
      
**Reviewer 2:** For the number of siblings and spouse, I don't think it is necessary to list all the situations. Since most passengers had no siblings or spouse traveled with them, is it possible to recode this variable into two categories: travelling with siblings/spouse and without siblings/spouse?   
                   
**Reviewer 3:** After the SibSp was recoded, have you examined whether there's new interaction which is significant in the model?            
                     
                            
### Improved Versions Based on Feedback
**titanic_2.html:** Took the suggestions from Reviewer 1, changed the format of plot 2 and added titles for each plot.   
             
**titanic_3.html:** Took the suggestions from Reviewer 2. However, after recode this variable to two categories (with/without siblings or spouse travelling with the passenger), the new variable was not significant anymore in the model. So I recoded this variable into 3 categories: with no siblings/spouse (0), with one sibling/spouse (1), and with more than one sibling/spouse (more). This transformation is reasonable based on the plot, for the number of passengers with more than one sibling/spouse aboard was very low for each level, but the number of passengers with one sibling/spouse aboard was much larger. After this transformation, the new variable with three categories was still significant in the logistic model, for the survival of passengers with no siblings/spouse aboard had better chance to survive compared to passengers with more than 1 sibling/spouse aboard.      
                   
**titanic_final:** With the SibSp_category in the logistic model instead of the original SibSp, the interaction between SibSp_category and Pclass became significant. Therefore I considered to show the interaction in the new plot3 with animation.
